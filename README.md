# Modeling-and-forecasting
Various industries, including telecommunications, need to find patterns in their data. Because in this way, they can make better decisions by finding a linear or non-linear model that has an acceptable accuracy according to that industry. Also, by finding the patterns in the data, they can make an approximate prediction of their desired data for better analysis and more accurate decision making. For example, the code here predicts the variable amount of traffic using input variables in the telecommunications industry such as throughput, bandwidth, number of connected users, etc.
